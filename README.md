# Getting Started Folder Structure

1. Folder Structure
The folder structure is organized to separate concerns and keep things modular for better scalability and reuse.

```

Creating a reusable React Native app template is a great idea for saving time on future projects. When designing a template that can be reused multiple times, it’s essential to ensure modularity, flexibility, and ease of customization. Here are the key things to consider:

## 1. Project Structure & Organization
Modular folder structure: Organize your project into well-defined folders. For example:
``
/assets: Images, fonts, etc.
/components: Reusable UI components (buttons, headers, form inputs).
/screens: Different screens for your app.
/navigation: Navigation setup (React Navigation or any other navigation library).
/services: API calls, business logic.
/utils: Helper functions or utility files.
/constants: Shared constants like colors, font sizes, etc.
Separation of Concerns: Keep logic, UI, and styling separate where possible, so it's easier to manage and customize the app.

## 2. Reusable Components
Custom UI Components: Build a library of reusable components (like buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) that can be used across different screens. Use props to make them customizable.
Theming: Allow easy customization of the look and feel through themes (e.g., light and dark modes, primary colors, fonts). A centralized theme file can help manage this.
Cross-platform compatibility: Ensure your components and layout work well on both iOS and Android.
## 3. Navigation Setup
Use a navigation library (e.g., React Navigation) that can be easily modified or extended. Set up a simple navigation structure with stack, tab, and drawer navigation.
Keep navigation parameters and routes flexible so they can be customized for different use cases.
## 4. State Management
Choose a state management approach (e.g., Redux, React Context API, or Zustand). Ensure the state management is flexible and scalable to handle data between screens and components.
Avoid tightly coupling the app state to the components, making it reusable.
## 5. API Integration & Services
Make API calls modular by abstracting them into a separate service layer. This will allow easy integration of different APIs for various projects.
Consider adding a network layer to handle requests, responses, and errors gracefully.
## 6. Configuration & Environment Variables
Use configuration files for environment-specific settings (e.g., URLs, keys). This way, the template can easily be adapted for different environments (development, staging, production).
Tools like react-native-config can help you manage environment variables.
## 7. Styling & Responsiveness
Use Flexbox for layout design to ensure responsiveness on different screen sizes.
Avoid hardcoding dimensions (like widths and heights). Instead, use relative units or percentage-based measurements.
Consider using a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS (via tailwind-rn) or similar to simplify styling.
## 8. Authentication (if applicable)
Provide a customizable authentication flow. If your template requires user login, create reusable authentication components (like login forms, signup forms, token management).
Support common authentication strategies (e.g., token-based, OAuth, Firebase Authentication, etc.).
## 9. Internationalization (i18n)
If you expect the app to support multiple languages, set up internationalization (i18n) with libraries like i18next to manage translations and formats.
## 10. Error Handling & Logging
Build error handling into the template so that it’s easier to debug and maintain in future projects.
Use a logging mechanism (like Sentry or Reactotron) to capture runtime errors and performance metrics.
## 11. Performance Optimization
Lazy load components/screens where appropriate to improve app startup time.
Optimize images and assets for mobile devices.
Utilize code splitting and efficient state updates to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
## 12. Testability
Implement unit and integration tests to ensure the app template works correctly. Libraries like Jest and React Native Testing Library are good choices.
Keep test coverage in mind to allow you to maintain and scale the app efficiently.
## 13. Documentation
Provide clear and concise documentation for developers to easily understand how to use, extend, and customize the template.
Include instructions on setting up the environment, adding new screens, components, or services, and modifying the theme.
## 14. Versioning & Updating
Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and maintain different versions of the template.
Create a changelog to document any updates or modifications to the template.
## 15. Third-party Libraries & Dependencies
Minimize the use of unnecessary libraries. Only include the essential libraries for common functionality, like navigation, state management, or UI components.
Ensure that dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with React Native’s latest version.
## 16. Deployability
Consider setting up a simple deploy script to help users easily publish their app to the app stores or other platforms (via tools like Fastlane).
## 17. Accessibility
Ensure the app template supports basic accessibility features, like screen reader support, and ensure interactive elements are usable by everyone.


>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
